# Project Description

I'm a practitioner of the Internet of Things, and I think the privacy part of the Internet of Things is very important,

I believe in the future of the Internet of Things blockchain, and I also believe in the future of IOTEX. However, if a public chain wants to develop, it needs ecological support. With more projects, IOTEX will be naturally attractive, and with more people, IOTEX will be able to take off.

Based on this background, I want to develop an application and a platform to incubate IOTEX-related projects. Developers can raise IOTX on the platform, and investors can participate in the early stage of the project to obtain considerable income as the fund of the development project (the specific method of raising money is, Project issuers can exchange IOTX by issuing project tokens or hardware devices). Of course, projects that want to raise IOTX must pass some necessary reviews, and the authorities can also participate if they wish.
