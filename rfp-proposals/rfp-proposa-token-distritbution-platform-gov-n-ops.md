# Project Description

### Simple platform for vesting & payments

Our Token Distribution platform is the simplest way to grant tokens to project stakeholders using vesting strategies, airdrops, and other subscription methods.

The process of organizing and distributing tokens can be difficult and time-consuming for project developers and organizations. Web3 projects owners and managers face technological limitations and suffer from the lack of automated tools and awful user experiences, where they have to deal with:
- Operational overhead for token management
- Community and stakeholders pressure
- Governance and vesting schedules setup
- Recurrent token payments to teams & providers

However, our platform offers an easy and secure solution to tackle this issue, where users can:
- Organize and automate governance and vesting contracts
- Distribute batch payments with a spreadsheet and a few clicks
- Delegate financial responsibility within your team
- Be transparent with you stakeholders and reduce community pressure

This web app initially connects with EVM networks and provides a multi-chain experience, coming with basic configurable features, saving a significant amount of time for project owners and managers.

## Deliverables

We would be integrating our platform with IOTEX in such a way than its community and network can benefit from the DApp functionalities.
In addition to this, we would be improving the current solution and finalize a few steps of our roadmap.

## Development Roadmap

We are 3 developers working on the project at the moment, and the advances so far have been done in a month time.
We have just finished a multi-chain indexer and we are integrating it with the solution.
We expect to complete the functionality here described in the following 3 months.

## Total Budget Requested

20k USD - but we are looking for the support of several network partners to keep our team working actively, so we don't have a current cap.
Grants of 3-5k USD will keep us alive and working actively on it.

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

We plan to grow the platform including additional features to launch tokens & NFTs, and handle governance. Providing this way a holistic solution for DAO operations.
