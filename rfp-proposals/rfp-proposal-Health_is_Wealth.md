# Project Description

In the agricultural world, blockchain technology is being used for the transperancy of the used seeds, growing paramteres, roadmap of delivery and much more!

With Vita, the creation of a DCSA (Decentralised Community Supported Agriculture) would be very much plausible and would benefit the world in emitting less carbon & as well growing better nutrient packed food. The idea is to use computer vision applications that works hand in hand with the pebble tracker to create a one of kind mechanism named Proof of Growth.

The need to be transperant with the customer from the very first step is crucial, specially with the mentality shift the current pandemic has made us accustomed to.

## Deliverables

Please describe in details what your final deliverable for this project will be.

## Development Roadmap
| Deliverable | Dates | Funding Amount|
| --- | --- |---|
| Deliverable 1  | 15/08/2021-30/11/2021  | 5,000 USD  |
| Deliverable 2  | 01/12/2021-01/03/2022 | 9,000 USD  |
| Deliverable 3  | 02/03/2022-01/06/2022  | 9,000 USD  |


Deliverable 1:

A web-app that initiates the first part of the PoG(Proof of Growth).

The web-app will be able to execute the following subtasks : 

- Allow the user to load photos of corresponding plants growing in Vita from IPFS 
- Run a prediction application on the plants to see whether or not they are healthy
- Allow the user to see the environmental factors that attribute to the plant’s growth

The funding for this deliverable will be used for the following : 

1. Cloud computing services from either AWS &/or Microsoft AZURE
2. Back-end & Front-end development of the web app with the use of either Python or React.js
3. Hosting servers to deploy the web-app

Roles : Walid, Arul, Aaron & Erika

Deliverable 2:

As more hydroponic towers will be printed and setup for data collection whilst task 1 is being completed, simple federated learning integration follows up. 

New features will be added to the web-app & are planned as such : 
- Allow the users to see each others’ plants that are being grown and their corresponding progress 
- Allow the users to compare their progress with each other and correlate it to what type of incentives they will be getting rewarded from the pebble tracker

The funding for this deliverable will be used for the following : 
1. The purchase of more servers & cloud storage necessary for federated learning
2. The purchase for SIM cards bundled with data plans for the pebble trackers  
3. Back-end & Front-end development of the web app with the use of either Python or React.js
4. The development, and test runs, of a handful of smart-contracts for the use of comparison of growth

Roles : Walid, Aaron, & Erika

Deliverable 3:

Another set of features will be added (as the intention to have beta testers of the DAPP is in this stage) to the web-app as to create a DAPP from its base code:

- Create a decentralised marketplace where users can sell or buy from nearby Vita users
- Give the beta users the choice to either go public on the decentralised marketplace or not (users going public will benefit from higher incentive as they are helping create a much stronger federated model)
- Users will be notified to when their plants should be harvested as to have the best consumption of nutrition
- Users will be notified to what plants should be grown to help their communities

The funding for this deliverable will be used for the following : 
1. The development & test runs of the smart-contracts that will deal with the behaviour of the beta users
2. The full-stack development of the DAPP
3. Deploying the DAPP onto various app marketplaces

## Total Budget Requested

Total budget : 23,000 USD

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

The intention is to have Vita being powered by IoTeX, just as the Ucam.
