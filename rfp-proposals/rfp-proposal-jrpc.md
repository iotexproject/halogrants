# Open Grant Proposal: `IoJRP{`

**Name of Project:** IoJRP{

**Proposal Category:** Open ended proposal

**Proposer:** `Jeremi Rynkiewicz`

**Do you agree to open source all work you do on behalf of this RFP?:** Yes

# Project Description

To deploy a real fully devleloped IoTeX chain integration in conjunction with JerryIoPay

## Solution

I am developing a solution on JerryIoPay website https://jrpc.pl/

A 3D rendering of a website is what is the next norm. 3D graphics processing has become so cheap that simple HTTP renderings will be demoted to old fashioned and bland.

I am proposing a SDL2 based game integrated into the IOTEX network, which rewards users for certain actions in IoTeX network.

This can be from playing a SDL2 game on the rendering screen, to opening a browser page, copying data, pasting it to web command console (currently under development), which will reward users for completing steps, such as creating account, transferring money and "integrating" into the IoTeX framework via an online session. A Virtual "hacking" session for kids you can call it.

All data would be stored on a given publicly available network cloud infrastrcuture.
All code would be open source, in addition to potentially viable to be closed sourced projects libraries.

Score sheets would be kept

## Deliverables

Improve the code on https://jrpc.pl/

Proposed user action:

(right click anywhere on the background to open menu, click on icon to continue "hacking" - command console opens up, "Connect to IoPay" works, as long as user has ioPay wallet open an unlocked)
(right click anywhere on background to open SDL2 based rendered game in the background. Game never pauses, it is a 2D platformer (ala mario). User can always click JRPC icon to open hacking console.

All tokens collected via JRPC game would need to be transferred manually via in-built 3D JRPC Console
