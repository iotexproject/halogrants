This repository is intended for developers who want to work on existing <i>"bounties"</i>, or community members who want to fund their own IoTeX projects and are looking for developers.

# Halo Bounties
Halo bounties are a "wishlist" of new features, bug fixes, or standalone projects proposed by the community or by the IoTeX Foundation. Bounties have a well defined scope of work, verifiable deliverables, and a funding limit. Anyone can start a bounty to fund their favorite idea and help the growth of the IoTeX ecosystem, and anyone can work on existing bounties and claim the reward once work is done.

## Work on a bounty
If you are a developer, or an ecosystem builder, choose from the current [list of bounties](https://github.com/iotexproject/halogrants/issues) any project you feel confident to complete: pay special attention to the bounty description, the expected deliverables, and get in contact with the Bounty funder for clarifications by either commenting under the Bounty, or reaching out to the funder contacts.

**Please notice**: Bounties can have different formats, make sure to clarify with the funder if multiple people are allowed to work on the same bounty, what are the rules to select who gets paid. If you feel like you are the right person for a specific bounty, you may try asking to get it *reserved for you*.

## Fund a bounty
If there is a new feature, a bug fix, or a project that you would to get implemented on IoTeX, you can fund your own bounty by adding it to this repository issues:

**Please notice**: if you create a bounty you are responsible for paying out the reward when work is submitted that fulfill all the requirements.

If you have a Gitcoin account, you may want to fund your bounty on Gitcoin to get more submissions:
