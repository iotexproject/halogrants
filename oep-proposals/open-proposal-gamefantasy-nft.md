### Project Description

---

The rise of Flow shows that NFT games are still popular. And NFT as collectibles are now increasingly recognized by blockchain users. So we plan to develop an Earn to Play game on the IoTeX public chain. This game contents of collection, auction, synthesis, lottery and other functions. And we plan to add some features, such as battle arena in the future. By the way ,we will add IoTeX's new hardware link with Pebble so that can provide more benefits to Pebble owners. There are four person on our team, a front-end developer, a back-end developer , a game planning, and an art. All of the members are all senior developers in game industry.

### Value

---

The main design purpose is Earn to Play, to increase players activity on the chain. It not only allows players to enjoy the fun of collecting but also earn some money in the game. It also serves the purpose of active on-chain transactions and other purposes to bring more activity for the public chain. The game can attracts the first users to invest through the art and bonus pools, thus motivating players to synthetically acquire raffle tickets. Every parts of the cats in the game can be combined, and specific combinations will give birth to extremely rare cats, thus leading to constant actions, such as synthesis and auction in order to get the rare cats. Further strengthen the on-chain activity of the public chain.

### Deliverables

---

The final product is a blockchain game that can be played on both mobile web, and desktop web. People are able to get rare cats on the chain by synthesizing them, and in the same time, we can take a commission for the pool of money. Thus players can be encouraged to synthesize transactions and thus extract fees from them for the purpose of filling up the bonus pool, while also enlivening the effective transactions on the chain. After that, the battle function is added so that players can enjoy more, not just collecting.
