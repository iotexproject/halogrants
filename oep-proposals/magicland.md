### Project Description

---
Magicland is an emerging sustainable decentralized one-stop DeFI portal that starts with yield farming powered on Arbitrium. 
Our focus is to provide a safe yield farming experience for our citizens who are supporting Magicland along the journey to become the most magical DeFI place on Arbitrum. 
Our vision is to create a long-lasting DeFI protocol on the Arbitrum where both the Magicland and its citizens will grow together to witness the rise of Arbitrum in gaining the iron chair of the L2 war.

### Value

---

As a new side chain boostraping its DeFI ecosystem, it often needs a inflow capital to the ecoystem to experience DeFI application. And the first DeFI application that can quickly educate the users about DeFI is yield farming application. 
Therefore, Magicland aims to be the most magical DeFI place on IoTeX to provide its users to learn, experience and familiar with the magic of DeFI. Magicland is attracting huge TVL as well as community engagement to stake their crypto assets 
especially IoTeX to earn MAGIC. We have launched on Arbitrum two days with an about $80M TVL and placed the second Dapp on the leaderboard of Aribtrum.
