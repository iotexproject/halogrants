Project Description

Roadmap

First of all, Filda will depoly lending protocol on IoTex. Community members can leverage their assests with FilDA to long or short the market. Further more, more liquidity will come to IoTeX ecosystem.

Secondly, FilDA will expand the asset class to include synthetic assets such as UNI V2. In addition, we will support credit lending, providing unsecured lending for secure and secure agreements, and improving capital efficiency. The first case might be leveraged farming. 

In the future, FilDA would also like to explore the NFT+DeFi scenario. DeFi is the catalyst that pushes NFT to expand its boundaries, despite the excitement that NFT is generating in the crypto space. Lending markets may be the missing ingredient in the NFT ecosystem. A mature NFT ecosystem needs to establish a market where people can either use NFT to obtain loans or lease their NFT for a profit. To this end, FilDA2.0 may explore how to provide liquidity to high-quality assets in the growing NFT market. 

Security is always the NO.1 priority to us. FilDA uses time locking and multiple-signature, and cooperate with third-party independent developers, white hats and security companies reviewing code together, like Slowmist, PeckShield, Certik, FairyProof, Knownsec.
