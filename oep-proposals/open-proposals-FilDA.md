Project Description

FilDA in brief:

- A decentralized money market with DAO governance.
- Peak TVL $2.1 billion on HECO.
- $20 million USD interest accrued on savings deposits in 10 months.



Roadmap

First of all, Filda will deploy a lending protocol on IoTeX. Community members can leverage their assets with FilDA to long or short the market, amongst other strategies. Furthermore, more liquidity will come to the IoTeX ecosystem.

Secondly, FilDA will expand the asset class to include synthetic assets such as UNI V2. In addition, we will support credit lending, providing unsecured lending for secure agreements, thereby improving capital efficiency. The first instance added could be leveraged farming. 

In the future, FilDA would also like to explore the NFT+DeFi scenario. DeFi is the catalyst that can push NFT to expand its boundaries, alongside the excitement that NFT is currently generating in the crypto space. Lending markets may be the missing ingredient in the NFT ecosystem. A mature NFT ecosystem needs to establish a market where people can either use NFT to obtain loans or lease their NFT for a profit. To this end, FilDA 2.0 may explore how to provide liquidity to high-quality assets in the growing NFT market. 

Security is always the primary priority for us. FilDA uses time locking and multi-signature mechanisms, cooperates with third-party independent developers, works alongside white hats and security companies reviewing code together (inc. Slowmist, PeckShield, Certik, FairyProof, Knownsec).
