# Open Grant Proposal: `Energy Meter`

**Name of Project:** Using IoTeX Cryptocurrency to 

**Proposal Category:** Trusted Devices / Data

**Proposer:** saulwiggin

**Do you agree to open source all work you do on behalf of this RFP?:** Yes

# Project Description

Cryptocurrency will in the future become a global currency. I have worked for years in the engineering sector and recently developed an energy monitoring system which was commerically released to measure energy consumed on a site and transfer this to a website deducted money for the energy consumed. I think this is an ideal idea to include Crypto into as it is a tried and tested commercial business model which product market fit. 

## Value

IoTeX allows and builds for a trusted internet of things. This is a critical part of the industrial internet of things infrastructure. An energy metering system which would allow monitoring and deduction of payment for the energy consumed. These might be attached to a house or an office building and perhaps incentives offered to the take up of the device. 

IoTeX branded energy metereing would add a new product line to your existing products such as pebble. This would provide additional income and provide a global, crypto solution to the digital energy market. It could be possible to incorperate the hardware and web solutions with payment into additional functionality for crypto and branding. 

## Deliverables

We would be proposing a new product branded with your cryptocurrency. This would include the hardware and the software (web) as well as payment systems and inclusion into the cryptocurrency infrastructure. We could discuss a commision percentage for money processed through the system. 

## Development Roadmap

The hardware is largly developed and software. It would require branding and perhaps a package design with yourselves. The cryptocurrency inclusion would need to be developed which could be done by myself and take a few months. 

## Total Budget Requested

We would not in theory require a budget from you however perhaps you could agree to pre-order an amount of these products. We are currently listed to provide a company blue castle with over 2000 energy monitors. We would therefore ask you to sign an agreement to purchase a certain amount once the development was completed to your satisfacation. They currently retail at Â£79.00 each. 

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

We are an established company with over 30 years experience with expertease in hardware and software and proven commercial success. It would be within our power to maintain the software as we do for other clients/
